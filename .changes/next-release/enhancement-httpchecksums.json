  "description": "[``botocore``] Added support for the SHA512 checksum algorithm. When the optional AWS CRT (``awscrt``) dependency is installed, support is also enabled for the XXHASH64, XXHASH3, and XXHASH128 checksum algorithms. Also added pass-through support for customer-provided MD5 checksum headers (without SDK-side MD5 calculation or validation)."

  "description": "[``botocore``] This migrates the event system to using sevice ids instead of either client name or endpoint prefix. This prevents issues that might arise when a service changes their endpoint prefix, also fixes a long-standing bug where you could not register an event to a particular service if it happened to share its endpoint prefix with another service (e.g. ``autoscaling`` and ``application-autoscaling`` both use the endpoint prefix ``autoscaling``). Please see the `upgrade notes <https://botocore.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/index.html#upgrade-notes>`_ to determine if you are impacted and how to proceed if you are."

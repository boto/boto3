Multi-Region Access Points
##########################

Amazon S3 Multi-Region Access Points (MRAPs) provide global endpoints that
applications can use to fulfill requests from Amazon S3 buckets located in
multiple AWS Regions. You can use them to build multi-Region applications
with the same architecture used by single-Region applications, then run those
applications anywhere in the world.

To learn more about using Multi-Region Access Points in your Boto3
application, see `Using Multi-Region Access Points with supported API
operations <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/MrapOperations.html>`_,
which offers a thorough explanation as well as examples for the CLI and for
the SDK for Python.

Amazon S3 buckets
#################

An Amazon S3 bucket is a storage location to hold files. S3 files are referred 
to as objects.

This section describes how to use the AWS SDK for Python to perform common 
operations on S3 buckets.


Create an Amazon S3 bucket
==========================

The name of an Amazon S3 bucket must be unique across all regions of the AWS 
platform. The bucket can be located in a specific region to minimize latency
or to address regulatory requirements.

.. code-block:: python

    import logging
    import boto3
    from botocore.exceptions import ClientError


    def create_bucket(bucket_name, region=None):
        """Create an S3 bucket in a specified region

        If a region is not specified, the bucket is created in the S3 default
        region (us-east-1).

        :param bucket_name: Bucket to create
        :param region: String region to create bucket in, e.g., 'us-west-2'
        :return: True if bucket created, else False
        """

        # Create bucket
        try:
            if region is None:
                s3_client = boto3.client('s3')
                s3_client.create_bucket(Bucket=bucket_name)
            else:
                s3_client = boto3.client('s3', region_name=region)
                location = {'LocationConstraint': region}
                s3_client.create_bucket(Bucket=bucket_name,
                                        CreateBucketConfiguration=location)
        except ClientError as e:
            logging.error(e)
            return False
        return True


List existing buckets
=====================

List all the existing buckets for the AWS account.

.. code-block:: python

    # Retrieve the list of existing buckets
    s3 = boto3.client('s3')
    response = s3.list_buckets()

    # Output the bucket names
    print('Existing buckets:')
    for bucket in response['Buckets']:
        print(f'  {bucket["Name"]}')
